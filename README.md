# Procedure

## Data Collection
Before constructing a similarity space, it is first necessary to obtain data on the similarity of the ùëõ elements to be represented in it. A large language model (LLM) can be asked to estimate the similarity between all possible pairs with these ùëõ elements.
Here, the LLM prompt explicitly asks for a similarity value set between 0 and 100, where 0 corresponds to maximum dissimilarity and 100 to identity. We assume that the similarity relation satisfies the following two constraints:
   * **Identity**. For any element _i_, the similarity of _i_ to itself is maximal :
    $$‚àÄi \quad Similarity(i,i)=100 $$
    
   * **Symetry**. For any pair of distinct elements _i_ and _j_, the similarity of _i_ with _j_ is equal to the similarity of _j_ with _i_.
     $$i.e. \quad ‚àÄi,j \quad Similarity(i,j) = Similarity(j,i)$$.

Thus, in total, $`\left(\begin{matrix}n\\2\end{matrix}\right) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}`$ different similarity judgment requests are sent serially to the LLM via an API. 

### Data formatting
We arrange these data in a $n \times n$ _similarity matrix_ . This matrix reflects the similarity judgements between these elements: each cell $`(i,j)`$ of the matrix contains the similarity of ùëñ with ùëó.
Following the identity constraint, for any integer _i_ up to _n_, all cells _(i,i)_ of the matrix will be equal to 100. 
Following the symmetry constraint, it's a symmetric matrix : $`(j,i)=(i,j)`$ for all _i_ and _j_.
<br>
Since there are $`n^2`$ cells in the matrix, the _n_ diagonal elements have been set to 100, and we only need to calculate half of the remaining values, there are still $`\frac{n^2 - n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}`$ values to be requested to fill the matrix.

  
## Dimensionality reduction
_Multidimensional Scaling_ (MDS)  makes it possible to project these ùëõ elements into a lower-dimensional space, while preserving the initial similarity relationships as far as possible. More specifically, it involves minimising a cost function called _Stress_, which measures the difference between the initial similarities and the distances in the projected space. The quality of a spatial representation obtained by an MDS can be visualised in a graph called a Shepard diagram.

In order to apply multidimensional scaling, the **similarity matrix** is converted into a **dissimilarity matrix** with :
```
dissimilarity_matrix = 1 - (similarity_matrix / 100)
```

From the previous properties it is clear that this dissimilarity matrix is also symmetrical and that all its diagonal elements are 0.

We apply a multidimensional scaling on this dissimilarity matrix with :
```
mds = MDS(n_components=2, dissimilarity='precomputed', random_state=42)
coordinates = mds.fit_transform(dissimilarity_matrix)
```




The pyton codes presented will be used to construct similarity spaces, such as the one below, obtained with Gemini-1.5-Pro :

## Glossary

The _Stress_ cost function measures the difference between initial dissimilarities in the data and distances in the projected space.
<br> The raw Stress of a spatial configuration X is given by the sum of the squares of the differences between the initial dissimilarities and distances in X. 
Let's denote $`\delta_{i,j}`$ the dissimilarity between element $`i`$ and element $`j`$ in the initial data. 
The distance between the coordinates of $`i`$ and the coordinates of $`j`$ in the spatial configuration X will be denoted $`\mathcal{D}\left(i_X,j_X\right)`$. Thus, Raw Stress can be written as

$`{Stress}_{raw}\left(X\right)=\ \sum_{i\ =\ 1}\sum_{j\ =\ i+1}\left(\mathcal{D}\left(i_X,j_X\right)-\delta_{i,j}\right)`$

Borg and Groenen ([2005](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28981-X), p. 42) consider, however, that the value of raw stress can be biased by several factors, making it not very informative.
